# Profiling

PatrolBot runs on a Raspberry Pi, and most of its non-obvious design decisions exist to fit inside
that machine's limits. This page collects the performance characteristics worth knowing and how to
measure them.

## The numbers that matter

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Localization ready | a few seconds | `map_server` + `amcl` load first |
| Full navigation active | expected ~70 s from power-on after network-wait fix | older cold-boot measurements were ~3 min |
| Navigation start delay | 20 s | `TimerAction` keeps costmaps from starving localization |
| Telemetry rate | ~20 Hz (`/odom`, `/scan`) | from the SBC |
| Bridge TF rate | 50 Hz | `odom→base_link` |
| RPP control loop | 5 Hz | local costmap must match |
| Velocity smoothers | 20 Hz | |
| File-descriptor limit | `ulimit -n = 1024` | forces single-container composition |

## The three Pi constraints that shaped the design

### 1. Memory — the large map OOMs

Loading the occupancy map's PGM with multi-threaded image decode OOM-kills the process. Mitigations:

- `MAGICK_THREAD_LIMIT=1`, `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` (single-threaded decode).
- The active static map is `3192×2205 @ 0.075 m`; the global costmap is intentionally coarser at
  `0.2 m` and the local costmap is `0.1 m`.

Measure:

```bash
ssh robot-pi2 "free -h; docker exec patrolbot-navigation bash -lc \
  'cat /proc/\$(pgrep -f component_container_isolated)/status | grep VmRSS'"
```

### 2. File descriptors — DDS port exhaustion

With `ulimit -n = 1024`, running Nav2 as ~13 separate processes exhausts FastDDS shared-memory port
locks under `/dev/shm` and breaks lifecycle discovery. One composed `nav2_container` = one DDS
participant = one set of locks. This is **why composition is mandatory** (see
[Software Architecture](../architecture/software-architecture.md#the-composed-nav2_container-and-why-composition-is-mandatory)).

Measure:

```bash
ssh robot-pi2 "docker exec patrolbot-navigation bash -lc \
  'ulimit -n; ls /dev/shm | wc -l; ls -l /proc/\$(pgrep -f component_container_isolated)/fd | wc -l'"
```

### 3. CPU — startup contention

The 20 s navigation delay exists because costmap inflation of the large map competes with
localization during the container's sequential composable-node loading. Staging lets `map→odom`
lock in fast, then loads the heavy half.

Measure:

```bash
ssh robot-pi2 'docker stats --no-stream patrolbot-navigation patrolbot-bridge patrolbot-bringup'
```

## Measuring runtime performance

```bash
# Topic rates (quick health)
ssh robot-pi2 "docker exec patrolbot-navigation bash -lc \
  'source /opt/ros/\$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash; ros2 topic hz /scan /odom /cmd_vel'"

# End-to-end latency sanity: command issued vs. /cmd_vel published
ros2 topic delay /cmd_vel       # if your distro's tooling supports it

# Per-node CPU
ros2 run rqt_top rqt_top         # or plain top, filtered to ROS processes
```

## Tuning levers (and their costs)

| Lever | Effect | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Map resolution / scale | different static map geometry | must be operator-verified against laser overlay before use |
| `controller_frequency` | smoother control | more CPU; local costmap must keep pace |
| `max_particles` (AMCL) | better localization | more CPU per scan |
| RPP speed / lookahead | faster robot | re-tune lookahead, rotation behavior, accel limits, and re-check `base_shift_correction` assumption |
| Composition off | easier per-node debugging | **breaks** on this Pi (FD exhaustion) — don't |

## What is **not** profiled

- The SBC side during a disconnected-link test. ARIA loop timing and the server's
  send path should be re-measured under the intended load.
- Network throughput of the TCP stream. At ~20 Hz of short text lines it is negligible on a LAN;
  it would matter only over a constrained link.
